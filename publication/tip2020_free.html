                <h2>Abstract</h2>
				Currently, video text spotting tasks usually fall into
the four-staged pipeline: detecting text regions in individual images, recognizing localized text regions frame-wisely, tracking text
streams and post-processing to generate final results. However,
they may suffer from the huge computational cost as well as suboptimal results due to the interferences of low-quality text and
the none-trainable pipeline strategy. In this paper, we propose
a fast and robust end-to-end video text spotting framework
named FREE by only recognizing the localized text stream onetime instead of frame-wise recognition. Specifically, FREE first
employs a well-designed spatial-temporal detector that learns text
locations among video frames. Then a novel text recommender
is developed to select the highest-quality text from text streams
for recognizing. Here, the recommender is implemented by
assembling text tracking, quality scoring and recognition into
a trainable module. It not only avoids the interferences from
the low-quality text but also dramatically speeds up the video
text spotting. FREE unites the detector and recommender into a
whole framework, and helps achieve global optimization. Besides,
we collect a large scale video text dataset for promoting the
video text spotting community, containing 100 videos from 21
real-life scenarios. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks
show our method greatly speeds up the text spotting process, and
also achieves the remarkable state-of-the-art.

                <h2>Highlights Contributions</h2>
                	<p> ❃ We achieve the video text spotting in an
end-to-end trainable manner instead of the two-staged form
in its conference version. To achieve this, we replace EAST with an end-to-end trainable text spotting framework Text
Perceptron (abbr. TP), in which the original recognition
module in TP is replaced with our text recommender submodule. </p>
			<p> ❃ We further enhance the text recommender module by redesigning the template estimation mechanism in a
learnable manner rather than roughly synthesizing templates
by K-Means. This is because K-Means is inherently sensitive to outlier samples and not robust to complex scenarios.</p>
			<p> ❃ Correspondingly, we explore the effects of FREE with
more extensive experimental evaluations, which demonstrates
the advantages of the extended version. Besides, we refine
LSVTD by removing some consecutive background frames,
and provide more detailed characteristics.</p>
