                <h2>Abstract</h2>
Recurrent neural network (RNN) has been widely studied in sequence learning tasks, while the mainstream models (e.g., LSTM and GRU) rely on the gating mechanism (in control of how information flows between hidden states). However, the vanilla gates in RNN (e.g., the input gate in LSTM) suffer from the problem of gate undertraining, which can be caused by various factors, such as the saturating activation functions, the gate layouts (e.g., the gate number and gating functions), or even the suboptimal memory state etc.. Those may result in failures of learning gating switch roles and thus the weak performance. In this paper, we propose a new gating mechanism within general gated recurrent neural networks to handle this issue. Specifically, the proposed gates directly short connect the extracted input features to the outputs of vanilla gates, denoted as refined gates. The refining mechanism allows enhancing gradient back-propagation as well as extending the gating activation scope, which can guide RNN to reach possibly deeper minima. We verify the proposed gating mechanism on three popular types of gated RNNs including LSTM, GRU and MGU. Extensive experiments on 3 synthetic tasks, 3 language modeling tasks and 5 scene text recognition benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.				<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11338.pdf" target="_blank"

                <h2>Highlights Contributions</h2>
                	<p> ❃ We provide a deeper
understanding of gating mechanism in GRNNs and focus on the
widely existing chanllenging problem: gate undertraining. </p>
			<p> ❃ We
propose a new gating mechanism enhancing the vanilla gates using
simple yet effective refining operations, which is verified to be well
adapted in existing GRNN units like LSTM, GRU and MGU.</p>
			<p> ❃ We show intuitive evaluation on gate controlling ability through
well-designed sequential tasks, i.e., adding and counting, and offer
reasonable illustrations both qualitatively and quantitatively
</p>

<p>Experiments on various tasks, including 3 synthetic datasets and
multiple real-world datasets (3 language modeling tasks and 5 scene
text recognition benchmarks) demonstrate that the proposed gate
refinement mechanism can effectively boost GRNN learning.
